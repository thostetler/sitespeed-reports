# Sitespeed.io Performance Testing

This repository is set up to run performance tests using [Sitespeed.io](https://www.sitespeed.io/). The `test.sh` script dynamically runs tests on URLs listed in the `urls` directory, generating performance reports stored in the `sitespeed-result` directory. The results are published to a static site available at [https://thostetler.github.io/sitespeed-reports/](https://thostetler.github.io/sitespeed-reports/).

## Folder Structure

- **.github/workflows/**: Contains GitHub Actions workflows (if any) for automating testing or CI/CD processes.
- **sitespeed-result/**: Stores the output and reports generated by Sitespeed.io for each test.
- **sitespeed-reports/**: Additional directory for storing reports or analysis results.
- **urls/**: Contains `.txt` files, each representing a list of URLs for a specific test. Each test file is named after the service (e.g., `pubmed.txt`, `google-scholar.txt`).
- **test.sh**: Bash script that runs Sitespeed.io Docker commands based on the specified test name or all tests in the `urls` directory if no specific test name is provided.

## Usage

### Running Tests

To execute a test, run the `test.sh` script from the command line. You can specify a test by name or run all tests:

```bash
# Run a specific test by name (e.g., 'nectar')
./test.sh nectar

# Run all tests in the 'urls' folder
./test.sh
